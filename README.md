My cwk2 for Enterprise Application Development

This coursework is not intended to be copied, any plagiarism brought against you for using this project is your own fault.
It is simply here to help you understand how it should work for those that have not used C# before or are stuck.

Note that this implimentation does not include any generated forms, so you will lose a lot of marks for not figuring that out if it is part of your specification.

Also be aware that as this repo is public, any coursework handed in with copy pasted code from here will trigger the turnitin plagiarism detection so at least reference this repo to mitigate some of it, or simply understand the code and implement your own version.
